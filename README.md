# IPC-Spy

Spy on inter process comunication(IPC)

## What does it do?

It spys on ipc communications, by replacing the binary that is spawned with a
wrapper that logs all the communication while still forwrading the messages to
the original processes

This is for example useful to see what an lsp is sending exactly, or any ohter
based ipc setup.

## Install

`deno install -A jsr:@sigmasd/ipc-spy`

## Usage

`ipc-spy $pathTotargetfile`

This will create a new executable with `-spy` suffix appeneded to it in the
current directory.

The next step is to run the new program `$pathTotargetfile-spy` or make another
program call it (like a text editor in case of lsp).

Now the messages will be logged to `$tmp/${executable_name}_stdin.log`,
`$tmp/${executable_name_stdout}.log` and `$tmp/${executable_name_stderr}.log`
